phases:
  # The install phase includes commands that install dependencies that your tests use.
  # Default dependencies for testing frameworks supported on Device Farm are already installed.

      # This test execution environment uses Appium version 1.9.1 by default, however we enable you to change it using the Appium version manager (avm). An
      # example "avm" command below changes the version to 1.14.2.
      # For your convenience, we have preinstalled the following versions: 1.9.1, 1.10.1, 1.11.1, 1.12.1, 1.13.0, 1.14.1, 1.14.2, 1.15.1 or 1.16.0.
      # To use one of these Appium versions, change the version number in the "avm" command below to your desired version:
      - export APPIUM_VERSION=1.14.2
      - avm $APPIUM_VERSION

      # The goal is to run to your tests jar file with all the dependencies jars in the CLASSPATH.
      # Alternatively, You may specify your customized command.
      # Note: For most use cases, the default command works fine.
      # Please refer "http://testng.org/doc/documentation-main.html#running-testng" for more options on running TestNG tests from the command line.

      # To run your tests with testng.xml file, use the following sequence:
      # Note: you don't have to unzip your test jar unless you have xml file with custom name
      # 1. Your testng.xml is inside the test jar after packaging step. Unzip it using commands:
      # - echo "Unzipping TestNG tests jar"
      # - unzip *-tests.jar
      # 2. Run your TestSuite by specifying the unzipped testng.xml using commands:
      # - echo "Start Appium TestNG test"
      # - java org.testng.TestNG -d $DEVICEFARM_LOG_DIR/test-output testng.xml
