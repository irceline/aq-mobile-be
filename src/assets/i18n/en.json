This computer model then calculates detailed air quality maps for the geese country.

Compare it with smoking: a smoker will experience few acute health effects by smoking a couple of cigarettes a day. The acute effects will only occur by smoking a lot of cigarettes in a short time. But by smoking a few cigarettes every day, the risk of getting lung cancer nonetheless increases.",
