In places with more NO2, there is a greater risk of asthma attacks and the number of hospital admissions due to respiratory complaints increases. NO2 is mainly emitted during combustion processes at high temperatures. The most important source are diesel cars.",

When inhaled, O3 can cause lung irritation and impaired lung function.  In places with more O3, there is a greater risk of asthma attacks and the number of hospital admissions due to respiratory complaints increases. Indoors, ozone concentrations are generally only half as high as outdoors.",
				"about-pm10": "Particulate matter (PM10) consists of very small suspended matter of different size, origin and chemical composition. When inhaled, these small particles cause inflammatory reactions in the respiratory tract that hinder oxygen uptake. People with respiratory diseases and/or cardiovascular diseases are particularly sensitive to this. Fine dust can also carry carcinogenic particles. PM10 are all particles smaller than 10 micrometres. The difference with the smaller PM2.5 fraction is mainly coarser particles in windblown dust (e.g. sand, dust blown up from the road surface by passing cars, etc.).",
				"about-pm25": "Fine dust (PM2.5) consists of very small suspended matter of different size, origin and chemical composition. When inhaled, these small particles cause inflammatory reactions in the respiratory tract that hinder oxygen uptake. People with respiratory diseases and/or cardiovascular diseases are particularly sensitive to this. Fine dust can also carry carcinogenic particles. PM2.5 are all particles smaller than 2.5 micrometres. PM2.5 is therefore part of the larger PM10 fraction. PM2.5 is largely formed in the atmosphere from other pollutants (nitrogen oxides, ammonia, sulphur dioxide, etc.) but also consists of particles released during combustion processes (soot from the combustion of diesel or wood, etc.).",
